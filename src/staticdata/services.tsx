        In February 2021 I stumbled upon Web3, Crypto and Blockchains. I have
        been spellbound ever since. Developing apps that utilize a world-wide
        distributed, secure ledger is just mind-blowing{' '}

        <h3>Where am I headed?</h3>I already learnt the basics of developing
        Solidity (Ethereum) and Rust (Elrond) smart contracts and integrating
        them on a reactive, blazing-fast frontend like React or Next.js. I am
        still learning though and will update this section whenever I feel ready
        to "go to production".
        <h3>Get in touch</h3>
        My inbox is still open to Web3-related requests. I also have connections
        to Web3-Developers. So why don't you{' '}

        reference.
        <h3>What is the right fit for you?</h3>
        React (or Next.js) pages are super fast and rely on the latest
        technology available, but also take more time to develop. Wordpress is
        more suited for static websites or websites that don't require
        cutting-edge speed. I can build with both, which one to use on{' '}
        <i>your</i> site also highly depends on your vision and budget.

        I studied Human-Computer-Interaction at the University of WÃ¼rzburg in
        Bavaria, Germany. The degree program taught me to recognize, evaluate
        and strive for the usability of software.
        <h3>What is usability?</h3>
        Broadly spoken, usability is the ease-of-use you feel when using a
        specific software. A good usability is key to a enjoyable user
        experience (UX).
        <h3>Get in touch</h3>I can analyze the usability of your product, as
        well as giving design implications to enhance it. If you&#39;re
        interested in boosting the usability of your product to the next level,{' '}
