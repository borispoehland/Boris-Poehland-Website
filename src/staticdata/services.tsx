        In February 2021 I stumbled upon Web3, Crypto and Blockchains. I have
        been spellbound ever since. Developing apps that utilize a world-wide
        distributed, secure ledger is just mind-blowing{' '}
        <Emoji label="Mind blown emoji" symbol="ðŸ¤¯" />
        <h3>Where am I headed?</h3>I already learnt the basics of developing
        Solidity (Ethereum) and Rust (Elrond) smart contracts and integrating
        them on a reactive, blazing-fast frontend like React or Next.js. I am
        still learning though and will update this section whenever I feel ready
        to "go to production".
        <h3>Get in touch</h3>
        My inbox is still open to Web3-related requests. I also have connections
        to Web3-Developers. So why don't you{' '}

        IT guys are expected to do anything tech related - from coding websites,
        to troubleshooting shutdown issues, up to fixing the damn printer. We
        are problem solvers by heart, and over the years I gained valuable

        I studied Human-Computer-Interaction at the University of WÃ¼rzburg in
        Bavaria, Germany. The degree program taught me to recognize, evaluate
        and strive for the usability of software.
        <h3>What is usability?</h3>
        Broadly spoken, usability is the ease-of-use you feel when using a
        specific software. A good usability is key to a enjoyable user
        experience (UX).
